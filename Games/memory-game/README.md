## Project 3 - Memory Game

This is a Memory game with HTML, CSS and JS.

### Description
 - The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched
 - 3 levels of difficulty
 - game timer: when the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
 - The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it displays 3 stars. After 1 wrong move for _Easy_, 8 wrong moves for _Normal_ and 18 wrong moves for _Hard_ a star is lost, and then again for the same number of moves. Rating doesn't fall below 1 star.
 - When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It also tells the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
